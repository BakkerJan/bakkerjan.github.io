This post is all about the hack on Microsoft by Midnight Blizzard (NOBELIUM, Cozy Bear, APT29)  
A lot has been said already, and this event has many angles. This post is focused on one part:

**What can Entra/Microsoft 365 admins do to prevent such an attack?**

I don't have all the answers (certainly not!) but I feel the urge to bundle all the resources so that the community can find guidance during this snowstorm. I did not find any time to put something on paper myself, but this hack has kept me busy for the past few days. During that period, a lot of good resources already came out, so that's what I'd like to share.

## TL;DR

1. The attack was not the result of a vulnerability in Microsoft products or services. The attacker gained access through unprotected accounts, overprivileged apps, and a lack of governance and alerting.

3. The motive was most likely to gain insights into the information Microsoft had about the attacker. At one point, it seemed that the attacker had unlimited control over the entire production tenant, but they "just" exfiltrated email and documents from targetted accounts.

5. Admins should review all service principals that have the highest privilege Entra ID roles and MS Graph app roles in the first place. Then follow up on the recommendations in the various blogposts.
