![Global Automation Bootcamp 2021 Conference](/assets/images/Global-Automation-Bootcamp-2021-Conference.jpg)

I'm very excited to announce my session for the Global Automation Bootcamp 2021. In this session, I will show how I solved real-world challenges with the use of Power Automate and Graph API. You will learn the concept of my solutions so that you can build your own solution for your next challenge. Even though my day to day work is mostly focused on Modern Workplace, Azure Active Directory, and Office 365, I have found great value in the Power Platform. During this session, I will show you both the challenges and the solutions.

[Global Automation Bootcamp](https://events.powercommunity.com/global-automation-bootcamp-2021/) will begin on the 5th February 2021 where we will be holding full day Automation Bootcamps on _Power Automate, Powershell, Azure, LogicApps, Functions, RPA, Selenium_ to help you automate administrative manual business operations.
