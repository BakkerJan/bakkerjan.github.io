This post is about WinRAR. We all know WinRAR for it's never expiring trial period and the annoying pop-up that we have massively ignored for decades now. At least, in the personal space. I think there are not that many people that bought a WinRAR license for their personal computer, out of principles, guilt, or even accidentally. Including me. I have never owned a WinRAR license myself.

But that has changed. I actually bought my very own license last month. And the reason for that is threefold:

1. I run a business now. And I'd like to keep things legal.
2. I was curious about the process, and wanted to go through this experience to see what it took to buy a license.
3. To me it is also a collectors item. Something you can proudly stall on the office shelf.

Now, let's back up a little, and take a look at the license agreement of WinRAR. Statement 2 is pretty clear about it:

```
2. The software is distributed as try before you buy. This means that
     anyone may use the software during a test period of a maximum of 40 days
     at no charge. Following this test period, the user must purchase
     a license to continue using the software.
```

But we all know, it does not work that way. After the trial period expires, we are massively hitting this close button every time we use it.

Now, as I stated, there are a lot of jokes and memes about WinRAR. I added some of them to this post, and they really make me laugh.

## Buying a license

And so it happened. On a bright sunny day, I headed over to the [WinRAR webshop](https://shop.win-rar.com/16/purl-shop-2183-1-n?x-source=31-buylink-startpage), and then I was happily surprised when I saw the order page. It had a checkbox to add a WinRAR Physical Delivery on CD.

And then I was like: nah, that's a joke. Who orders that? So I added the CD to the basket to see if it would ever arrive. But not long after I placed the order, I got this wonderful email:

So I decided to write back and to come clean to the WinRAR sales team. I told them that I was surprised about the CD, and asked them how many licenses they sell each year. That's the question right? How does WinRAR make money? Well, they sell a bunch of licenses to businesses on daily basis. I don't have the actual numbers, but what surprised me the most is the number of physical CDs that they ship each year. Can you believe that?

It took 4 weeks for mine to arrive. Since I had no integrated CD/DVD player in any of my devices, I also bought a portable/external reader.

The disc is holding the installation source and the WinRAR key. It even got Autorun!

So, after running the installation, I could finally make this official and add my license. Look at that! How cool.

## Upon the wall

Now, I've seen several examples of folks that framed their CD and/or license, and that seemed like the perfect idea to me. So I bought a frame on eBay, to show off this beautiful piece of art in my office. Now doesn't that look pretty?

## Wrap things up

What started as a joke basically, because I was curious about the CD, ended up being a fun experience to actually order WinRAR, receive the CD, get in touch with WinRAR sales, find a way to actually read the CD, and frame the whole thing to shine on my wall. If you also want this, here's my shopping list:

- [CD / Music Album Cover Memoribilia Frame](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/252601869114?euid=null&bu=45136951087&crd=20211116120306&osub=-1~1&ch=osgood&cp=1&sojTags=bu=bu,ch=ch,segname=segname,crd=crd,url=loc,osub=osub)Â 
- [WinRAR license + physical CD](https://shop.win-rar.com/16/purl-shop-2183-1-n?x-source=31-buybutton-startpage)
- [External CD/DVD player/writer](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/externe-dvd-speler-brander-dvd-cd-drive-voor-laptop-macbook-data-voeding-via-usb-3-0-of-usb-c-van-zedar/9300000020924600/)

I also stumbled upon this hilarious Ipad cover:
