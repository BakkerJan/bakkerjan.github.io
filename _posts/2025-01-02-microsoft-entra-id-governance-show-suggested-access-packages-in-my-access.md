Today's post is about a new feature in Entra ID's Identity Governance: **_Show suggested access packages in My Access_**.

This feature provides users with a tailored list of suggested access packages. Instead of browsing through all available options, users can now quickly view the most relevant access packages based on their peers' choices and their past requests.

To enable the preview, go to: [Identity Governance - Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/?feature.msaljs=true#view/Microsoft_AAD_ERM/DashboardBlade/~/elmSetting)

Click **_Edit_**, and enable the preview: **Show suggested access packages in My Access**.

When users go to the Access Packages in My Access, they will see a new experience.

These personalized recommendations are generated by analyzing the user’s connections, such as their manager, direct reports, organization, and team members. The system then suggests access packages commonly used by these peers. Additionally, users will see access packages they’ve previously held, helping them reclaim access they might need again.

Based on a quick test, hidden access packages will also be suggested if the user requested the package earlier. In this case, the manager requested the package on behalf of the user, so it is suggested on the user's account, not the manager's account.
